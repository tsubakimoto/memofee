## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd memofee
   ```

2. **Build and run locally**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/Memofee.AppHost
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `https://localhost:5001`
   - Add your first RSS/Atom feed
   - Start browsing and noting articles

## Configuration

### Database

The application uses SQL Server with Entity Framework Core. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=MemoFee;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

### Authentication

For single-user access, configure the allowed user:

```json
{
  "ALLOWED_UPN": "your-email@domain.com",
  "ALLOWED_OID": "your-azure-object-id"
}
```

**Environment Variables for Production:**
- `ALLOWED_UPN`: User Principal Name (email) of the authorized user
- `ALLOWED_OID`: Azure AD Object ID of the authorized user (alternative to UPN)
- `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`: Database connection string

### Azure Deployment

1. **Create Azure Resources**:
   - Azure App Service (Linux recommended)
   - Azure SQL Database
   - Enable App Service Authentication

2. **Configure App Service Authentication**:
   - Enable Microsoft account or Azure AD authentication
   - Configure redirect URLs

3. **Set Application Settings**:
   - `ALLOWED_UPN` or `ALLOWED_OID`: Your authorized user identifier
   - `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`: Azure SQL connection string

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   # Deploy to Azure App Service
   ```

# GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è .NET

Want to try out the latest performance improvements coming with .NET for web development? 

This repo builds a Weather API, OpenAPI integration to test with [Scalar](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/using-openapi-documents?view=aspnetcore-9.0#use-scalar-for-interactive-api-documentation), and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET. 

We've given you both a frontend and backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you‚Äôre ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we‚Äôll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

### Run Options

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=lightgrey&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/github/dotnet-codespaces)
[![Open in Dev Container](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev+Container&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/github/dotnet-codespaces)

You can also run this repository locally by following these instructions: 
1. Clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/github/dotnet-codespaces`
1. Open repo in VS Code

## Getting started

1. **üì§ One-click setup**: [Open a new Codespace](https://codespaces.new/github/dotnet-codespaces), giving you a fully configured cloud developer environment.
2. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run all, one-click again**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded ports *8080* and *8081* in your browser.

3. The Blazor web app and Scalar can be open by heading to **/scalar** in your browser. On Scalar, head to the backend API and click "Test Request" to call and test the API.

4. **üîÑ Iterate quickly:** Codespaces updates the server on each save, and VS Code's debugger lets you dig into the code execution.

5. To stop running, return to VS Code, and click Stop twice in the debug toolbar.
